# Exercise 1: Deploy with Raw Manifests

Deploy the demo application to Kubernetes using kubectl and raw YAML manifests. This exercise demonstrates the fundamental workflow of declarative Kubernetes deployments.

## Objective

Create and apply Kubernetes manifests for a complete application stack including Deployment, Service, and ConfigMap. Verify all resources are created correctly and the application is accessible within the cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Phase 0 completed with validated environment
- kubectl context set to minikube
- Terminal open in the repository root directory

## Steps

### Step 1: Create Application Namespace

Create a dedicated namespace to isolate the application resources.
```bash
kubectl create namespace demo-app
```

Expected output:
```
namespace/demo-app created
```

Verify the namespace exists:
```bash
kubectl get namespaces
```

You should see `demo-app` in the list with STATUS "Active".

### Step 2: Review the Kubernetes Manifests

Before applying manifests, review their contents to understand what resources will be created.
```bash
# View the ConfigMap manifest
cat kubernetes/manifests/configmap.yaml

# View the Deployment manifest
cat kubernetes/manifests/deployment.yaml

# View the Service manifest
cat kubernetes/manifests/service.yaml
```

Note the key fields in each manifest:
- ConfigMap contains application configuration as key-value pairs
- Deployment specifies 2 replicas, container image, and resource limits
- Service uses ClusterIP type with selector matching deployment pod labels

### Step 3: Apply the ConfigMap

Apply the ConfigMap first since the Deployment references it.
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/manifests/configmap.yaml -n demo-app
```

Expected output:
```
configmap/demo-app-config created
```

Verify the ConfigMap was created:
```bash
kubectl get configmap -n demo-app
kubectl describe configmap demo-app-config -n demo-app
```

The describe output shows the data fields stored in the ConfigMap.

### Step 4: Deploy the Application

Apply the Deployment manifest to create the application pods.
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/manifests/deployment.yaml -n demo-app
```

Expected output:
```
deployment.apps/demo-app created
```

Watch the pods come online:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo-app --watch
```

Expected progression:
```
NAME                        READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
demo-app-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          5s
demo-app-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx   1/1     Running             0          15s
demo-app-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          5s
demo-app-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx   1/1     Running             0          15s
```

Press Ctrl+C once both pods show STATUS "Running" and READY "1/1".

### Step 5: Verify Pod Details

Examine one of the pods to understand its configuration.
```bash
# Get pod names
kubectl get pods -n demo-app

# Describe a specific pod (replace pod-name with actual name)
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n demo-app
```

Look for these sections in the output:
- **Labels**: Shows labels applied to the pod from the Deployment template
- **Containers**: Shows the container image, ports, and resource limits
- **Volumes**: Shows the ConfigMap mounted as a volume
- **Events**: Shows the timeline of pod creation including image pull and container start

### Step 6: Create the Service

Apply the Service manifest to expose the application.
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/manifests/service.yaml -n demo-app
```

Expected output:
```
service/demo-app-service created
```

Verify the Service was created:
```bash
kubectl get service -n demo-app
```

Expected output shows:
```
NAME               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
demo-app-service   ClusterIP   10.xxx.xxx.xxx  <none>        8080/TCP   10s
```

Note the CLUSTER-IP assigned to the Service.

### Step 7: Check Service Endpoints

Verify the Service found the pods using its selector.
```bash
kubectl get endpoints demo-app-service -n demo-app
```

Expected output shows two IP addresses (one for each pod replica):
```
NAME               ENDPOINTS                         AGE
demo-app-service   172.17.0.x:8080,172.17.0.y:8080   2m
```

If ENDPOINTS shows `<none>`, the Service selector does not match the pod labels. Verify labels match:
```bash
# Check Service selector
kubectl get service demo-app-service -n demo-app -o yaml | grep -A 5 selector

# Check pod labels
kubectl get pods -n demo-app --show-labels
```

### Step 8: Test Application Connectivity

Create a temporary pod to test connectivity to the Service from within the cluster.
```bash
kubectl run test-pod --image=curlimages/curl:latest --rm -it --restart=Never -n demo-app -- sh
```

This creates an interactive shell in a temporary pod. Once inside the pod, test the Service:
```bash
# Inside the test pod
curl http://demo-app-service:8080
curl http://demo-app-service:8080/health
```

Expected output from the first curl shows JSON response with hostname and version. The health endpoint should return status 200 OK.

Exit the test pod:
```bash
exit
```

The test pod is automatically deleted due to the `--rm` flag.

### Step 9: View Application Logs

Check the logs from the application pods to see request activity.
```bash
# View logs from all pods in the deployment
kubectl logs -l app=demo-app -n demo-app

# Follow logs in real-time from a specific pod
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n demo-app --follow
```

You should see log entries for the curl requests made in the previous step. Press Ctrl+C to stop following logs.

### Step 10: Inspect Deployment Status

Check the Deployment status to confirm it successfully rolled out.
```bash
kubectl get deployment demo-app -n demo-app
kubectl rollout status deployment/demo-app -n demo-app
```

Expected output:
```
deployment "demo-app" successfully rolled out
```

View detailed Deployment information:
```bash
kubectl describe deployment demo-app -n demo-app
```

Note the Replicas section showing desired, current, and available counts should all be 2.

## Verification

Confirm successful completion by checking:

1. Namespace `demo-app` exists:
```bash
   kubectl get namespace demo-app
```

2. ConfigMap contains expected data:
```bash
   kubectl get configmap demo-app-config -n demo-app -o yaml
```

3. Deployment shows 2/2 ready replicas:
```bash
   kubectl get deployment demo-app -n demo-app
```

4. Both pods are Running with 1/1 ready:
```bash
   kubectl get pods -n demo-app
```

5. Service has two endpoints:
```bash
   kubectl get endpoints demo-app-service -n demo-app
```

6. Application responds to requests (from test pod or port-forward)

## Cleanup

Leave resources running for the next exercise. If you need to clean up:
```bash
kubectl delete namespace demo-app
```

This deletes the namespace and all resources within it.

## Common Issues

**Pods stuck in ContainerCreating:**
Wait 30 seconds. If still stuck, check events with `kubectl describe pod`. Common causes are image pull delays on first download.

**Service has no endpoints:**
Service selector does not match pod labels. Verify selector matches exactly using the commands in Step 7.

**Cannot reach Service from test pod:**
Verify Service exists and has endpoints. Check that you used the correct Service name and namespace in the curl command.

## Success Criteria

You have successfully completed this exercise when:
- All pods are Running with 1/1 ready
- Service has endpoints for both pods
- curl commands from test pod return successful responses
- Logs show request activity from your tests
